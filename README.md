<h2 align=center>Work in Progress</h2>

<br>

<p align=center>This script is my latest random project, a webscraper that in simple terms, scrapes the contents of each website listed in the config, and emails the user alerting them when said websites have recieved any updates in their source code using bs4.<br><br>A <a href='assets/update_scraper.service'>systemd service file</a> is included in /assets for those who want the script to run on system startup <sup>(systemd is a service manager for linux for those on windows running on startup wont work)</sup>. I havent tested this with other sites or pretty much at all yet, so make a pr if you get to it before I do. =D</p>
